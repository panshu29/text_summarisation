        "   - `AutoTokenizer` → Loads the matching tokenizer to preprocess input text into token IDs.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Loading a Pretrained Model**\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Preparing the Input**\n",
        "   - The input article is tokenized using the tokenizer.  \n",
        "   - `max_length=1024` → Ensures the input text does not exceed the model’s maximum context size.  \n",
        "   - `return_tensors=\"pt\"` → Returns **PyTorch tensors** instead of plain Python lists, so the model can process them.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Generating a Summary**\n",
        "   - The model takes the tokenized input and generates a sequence of token IDs representing the summary.  \n",
        "   - This step uses Pegasus’s **sequence-to-sequence generation** ability.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Decoding the Output**\n",
        "   - `tokenizer.batch_decode(...)` converts the generated token IDs back into readable text.  \n",
        "   - `skip_special_tokens=True` → Removes tokens like `<pad>`, `<s>`, `</s>` that are used internally by the model.  \n",
        "   - `clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False` → Prevents automatic changes to spacing, preserving the exact model output.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Purpose**\n",
        "   - `load_from_disk` is a function from Hugging Face `datasets`.  \n",
        "   - It loads a **previously saved dataset** from disk into memory so it can be used for training, evaluation, or preprocessing.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **How It Works**\n",
        "   - `'samsum_dataset'` → Path to the folder where the dataset was saved.  \n",
        "   - The function restores the **dataset object** exactly as it was saved, including:\n",
        "     - Features (columns, data types)\n",
        "     - Train/test splits\n",
        "     - Any preprocessing applied before saving\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Why It’s Useful**\n",
        "   - Avoids **re-downloading or re-processing** large datasets.  \n",
        "   - Ensures **reproducibility** — you can always load the exact dataset used in previous experiments.  \n",
        "   - Works with **any Hugging Face Dataset**, including custom datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Result**\n",
        "   - `dataset_samsum` now holds the dataset in memory as a `DatasetDict` object (usually with keys like `train`, `test`, `validation`).  \n",
        "   - You can access individual splits:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     dataset_samsum['train']   # training split\n",
        "     dataset_samsum['test']    # test split\n",
        "     ```\n",
